# Why??
Because why not!? This boilerplate sets the stage for any number of potential
websites -- blogs, landing pages, etc. All powered by 11ty, glued together with
webpack and ready to be made pretty by SASS/SCSS.

### What's in it?
* 11ty
* Webpack
* node-sass, css-mini-extract-plugin
* An index.pug (but because of the majest of 11ty you can change this up and it will still work fine)
